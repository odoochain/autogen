Facebook Inc. has indeed rebranded to Meta Platforms Inc. and its ticker symbol has changed from FB to META on the NASDAQ stock exchange.\n\nLet's update the script to reflect this change:\n\n```python\n# filename: ytd_gain.py\n\nimport yfinance as yf\n\n# List of the 10 largest tech companies by market cap\n# Updated Facebook (FB) to Meta Platforms (META)\ntickers = ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL', 'AMZN', 'META', 'TSLA', 'NVDA', 'PYPL', 'ADBE', 'NFLX']\n\n# Get the YTD gain for each company\nytd_gains = {}\nfor ticker in tickers:\n    try:\n        ticker_data = yf.Ticker(ticker)\n        hist = ticker_data.history(period=\"ytd\")\n        start_price = hist.iloc[0]['Close']\n        end_price = hist.iloc[-1]['Close']\n        ytd_gain = (end_price - start_price) / start_price * 100\n        ytd_gains[ticker] = ytd_gain\n    except IndexError:\n        print(f\"Could not get data for {ticker}\")\n\n# Print the results\nfor ticker, ytd_gain in ytd_gains.items():\n    print(f\"{ticker}: {ytd_gain:.2f}%\")\n```\n\nTo run this script, save it to a file named `ytd_gain.py`, then run it with the command `python ytd_gain.py`.\n\nPlease note that this script requires the yfinance library. If you don't have this library installed, you can install it with the command `pip install yfinance`.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n>>>>>>>> USING AUTO REPLY...\n\n>>>>>>>> EXECUTING CODE BLOCK 0 (inferred language is python)...\nuser_proxy (to assistant):\n\nexitcode: 0 (execution succeeded)\nCode output: \nAAPL: 46.34%\nMSFT: 37.55%\nGOOGL: 51.08%\nAMZN: 56.17%\nMETA: 133.67%\nTSLA: 131.02%\nNVDA: 237.38%\nPYPL: -16.55%\nADBE: 59.71%\nNFLX: 43.44%\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nassistant (to user_proxy):\n\nThe script has successfully fetched the Year-to-Date (YTD) gain for the largest technology companies, including Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook).
