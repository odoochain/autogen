He'll also discuss the implications of o1-preview and its impact on multi-agent system development. In the second half, Eric shifts focus to his work on preparing pathways for emergent AI sentience, in the form of health checks for complex AI systems. He will discuss his research proposal using o1 as the first non-human reasoning agent to explore alternative logical conclusions to ethical quandaries as experienced by AI or other NHIs, aiming to ensure harmonious coexistence across these diverse intelligences."})]})}function d(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,s.a)(),...e.components};return t?(0,i.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,i.jsx)(h,{...e})}):h(e)}},11151:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{Z:()=>r,a:()=>o});var i=n(67294);const s={},a=i.createContext(s);function o(e){const t=i.useContext(a);return i.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function r(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(s):e.components||s:o(e.components),i.createElement(a.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
