He received his Ph.D. in electrical and computer engineering from the University of California, San Diego, USA, in 2022. Chia-Tung has several years of experience in the EDA industry. Before moving to the US, he worked for IDM and EDA companies in Taiwan, developing in-house design-for-manufacturing (DFM) flows at Macronix, as well as fastSPICE solutions at Mentor Graphics and Synopsis. During his Ph.D., he collaborated with the Design Technology Co-Optimization (DTCO) team at Synopsis and served as an AI resident at X, the Moonshot Factory (formerly Google X). His recent work focuses on developing LLM agents for chip design and integrating advanced knowledge extraction, task graph solving, and reinforcement learning techniques for debugging and design optimization.\\n\\n### Abstract:\\n\\nHardware design presents numerous challenges due to its complexity and rapidly advancing technologies. The stringent requirements for performance, power, area, and cost (PPAC) in modern complex designs, which can include up to billions of transistors, make hardware design increasingly demanding compared to earlier generations. These challenges result in longer turnaround times (TAT) for optimizing PPAC during RTL synthesis, simulation, verification, physical design, and reliability processes.\\nIn this talk, we introduce multi-AI agents built on top of AutoGen to improve efficiency and reduce TAT in the chip design process. The talk explores the integration of novel distilled knowledge debugging graphs, task graph solving, and multimodal capabilities within multi-AI agents to address tasks such as timing debugging, Verilog debugging, and Design Rule Check (DRC) code generation. Based on these studies, multi-AI agents demonstrate promising improvements in performance, productivity, and efficiency in chip design.\\n\\n### Sign Up:  https://discord.gg/8WFKcVN2?event=1300487847681196082\\n\\n## How to follow up with the latest talks?\\n\\nJoin our community Discord (https://discord.gg/sUkGceyd) to be the first to know about amazing upcoming talks!\\n\\nConnect: shaokunzhang529@gmail.com"},{"id":"/2024/10/15/index","metadata":{"permalink":"/autogen/talks/2024/10/15/index","source":"@site/talks/2024-10-15/index.mdx","title":"Agent-Model Orchestration in Multi-Agent Applications - Oct 15, 2024","description":"Speakers: Beibin Li","date":"2024-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 15, 2024","tags":[],"readingTime":1.01,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Agent-Model Orchestration in Multi-Agent Applications - Oct 15, 2024"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Upcoming  Talks","permalink":"/autogen/talks/future-talks"},"nextItem":{"title":"Advanced AutoGen Interactions and Ethical Pathways for AI Sentience - Oct 14, 2024","permalink":"/autogen/talks/2024/10/14/index"}},"content":"### Speakers: Beibin Li\\n\\n### Biography of the speakers:\\n\\nBeibin Li is currently a Senior Research Engineer at Microsoft Research, where his work centers on AI and combinatorial optimization for cloud operations.

Trace is a new AutoDiff-like framework for training AI workflows end-to-end with general feedback (like numerical rewards or losses, natural language text, compiler errors, etc.). Trace generalizes the back-propagation algorithm by capturing and propagating an AI workflow execution trace and applies LLM-based optimization to improve the workflow\u2019s performance.Trace is implemented as a PyTorch-like Python library and is compatible with any Python workflow. Users write Python code directly and can use Trace primitives to optimize certain parts (like codes, prompts, etc.), just like training neural networks!

However, traditional AI, such as vanilla tree search and RL, has several limitations: inability of high-level understanding of the environment, low generalizability, and low learning efficiency. Fortunately, the advent of foundation models has enabled us to build agents that overcome all those shortcomings. With foundation models, AI agents have the potential to possess (super-)human-level reasoning, acting, and planning abilities, which are the most important features for future AI agents. In this talk, we introduce LATS (Language Agent Tree Search), the first framework that realizes all three capabilities of LLMs in reasoning, acting, and planning. Our work enables LLMs as agents to leverage tree-based search algorithms while employing LLM-powered value functions and self-reflections for cleverer exploration, which provides a more adaptive problem-solving mechanism. We show that our method is 1) empirically successful on a variety of tasks across different domains including tool-use, coding, and web agents, 2) more efficient than prior tree-search-based works, and 3) importantly, conveniently adaptable for Autogen users."}]}')}}]);
