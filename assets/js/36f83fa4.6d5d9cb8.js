Maybe, but not today\nSummary:   Recent investigations show that large language models (LLMs), specifically\nGPT-4, not only have remarkable capabilities in common Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) tasks but also exhibit human-level performance on various\nprofessional and academic benchmarks. However, whether GPT-4 can be directly\nused in practical applications and replace traditional artificial intelligence\n(AI) tools in specialized domains requires further experimental validation. In\nthis paper, we explore the potential of LLMs such as GPT-4 to outperform\ntraditional AI tools in dementia diagnosis. Comprehensive comparisons between\nGPT-4 and traditional AI tools are conducted to examine their diagnostic\naccuracy in a clinical setting. Experimental results on two real clinical\ndatasets show that, although LLMs like GPT-4 demonstrate potential for future\nadvancements in dementia diagnosis, they currently do not surpass the\nperformance of traditional AI tools. The interpretability and faithfulness of\nGPT-4 are also evaluated by comparison with real doctors. We discuss the\nlimitations of GPT-4 in its current state and propose future research\ndirections to enhance GPT-4 in dementia diagnosis.\n\n\nTitle: GPT-4 Can't Reason\nSummary:   GPT-4 was released in March 2023 to wide acclaim, marking a very substantial\nimprovement across the board over GPT-3.5 (OpenAI's previously best model,\nwhich had powered the initial release of ChatGPT). However, despite the\ngenuinely impressive improvement, there are good reasons to be highly skeptical\nof GPT-4's ability to reason. This position paper discusses the nature of\nreasoning; criticizes the current formulation of reasoning problems in the NLP\ncommunity, as well as the way in which LLM reasoning performance is currently\nevaluated; introduces a small collection of 21 diverse reasoning problems; and\nperforms a detailed qualitative evaluation of GPT-4's performance on those\nproblems. Based on this analysis, the paper concludes that, despite its\noccasional flashes of analytical brilliance, GPT-4 at present is utterly\nincapable of reasoning.\n\n\nTitle: Evaluating the Logical Reasoning Ability of ChatGPT and GPT-4\nSummary:   Harnessing logical reasoning ability is a comprehensive natural language\nunderstanding endeavor. With the release of Generative Pretrained Transformer 4\n(GPT-4), highlighted as \"advanced\" at reasoning tasks, we are eager to learn\nthe GPT-4 performance on various logical reasoning tasks. This report analyses\nmultiple logical reasoning datasets, with popular benchmarks like LogiQA and\nReClor, and newly-released datasets like AR-LSAT. We test the multi-choice\nreading comprehension and natural language inference tasks with benchmarks\nrequiring logical reasoning. We further construct a logical reasoning\nout-of-distribution dataset to investigate the robustness of ChatGPT and GPT-4.\nWe also make a performance comparison between ChatGPT and GPT-4. Experiment\nresults show that ChatGPT performs significantly better than the RoBERTa\nfine-tuning method on most logical reasoning benchmarks. With early access to\nthe GPT-4 API we are able to conduct intense experiments on the GPT-4 model.\nThe results show GPT-4 yields even higher performance on most logical reasoning\ndatasets. Among benchmarks, ChatGPT and GPT-4 do relatively well on well-known\ndatasets like LogiQA and ReClor. However, the performance drops significantly\nwhen handling newly released and out-of-distribution datasets. Logical\nreasoning remains challenging for ChatGPT and GPT-4, especially on\nout-of-distribution and natural language inference datasets. We release the\nprompt-style logical reasoning datasets as a benchmark suite and name it\nLogiEval.\n\n\nTitle: How is ChatGPT's behavior changing over time?\nSummary:   GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are the two most widely used large language model (LLM)\nservices. However, when and how these models are updated over time is opaque.\nHere, we evaluate the March 2023 and June 2023 versions of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on\nseveral diverse tasks: 1) math problems, 2) sensitive/dangerous questions, 3)\nopinion surveys, 4) multi-hop knowledge-intensive questions, 5) generating\ncode, 6) US Medical License tests, and 7) visual reasoning. We find that the\nperformance and behavior of both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can vary greatly over time.\nFor example, GPT-4 (March 2023) was reasonable at identifying prime vs.\ncomposite numbers (84% accuracy) but GPT-4 (June 2023) was poor on these same\nquestions (51% accuracy). This is partly explained by a drop in GPT-4's amenity\nto follow chain-of-thought prompting. Interestingly, GPT-3.5 was much better in\nJune than in March in this task. GPT-4 became less willing to answer sensitive\nquestions and opinion survey questions in June than in March. GPT-4 performed\nbetter at multi-hop questions in June than in March, while GPT-3.5's\nperformance dropped on this task. Both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 had more formatting\nmistakes in code generation in June than in March. We provide evidence that\nGPT-4's ability to follow user instructions has decreased over time, which is\none common factor behind the many behavior drifts. Overall, our findings show\nthat the behavior of the \"same\" LLM service can change substantially in a\nrelatively short amount of time, highlighting the need for continuous\nmonitoring of LLMs.\n\n\nTitle: Gpt-4: A Review on Advancements and Opportunities in Natural Language\n  Processing\nSummary:   Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) is the fourth-generation\nlanguage model in the GPT series, developed by OpenAI, which promises\nsignificant advancements in the field of natural language processing (NLP). In\nthis research article, we have discussed the features of GPT-4, its potential\napplications, and the challenges that it might face. We have also compared\nGPT-4 with its predecessor, GPT-3. GPT-4 has a larger model size (more than one\ntrillion), better multilingual capabilities, improved contextual understanding,\nand reasoning capabilities than GPT-3. Some of the potential applications of\nGPT-4 include chatbots, personal assistants, language translation, text\nsummarization, and question-answering. However, GPT-4 poses several challenges\nand limitations such as computational requirements, data requirements, and\nethical concerns.\n\n\nTitle: Is GPT-4 a Good Data Analyst?\nSummary:   As large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their powerful capabilities\nin plenty of domains and tasks, including context understanding, code\ngeneration, language generation, data storytelling, etc., many data analysts\nmay raise concerns if their jobs will be replaced by artificial intelligence\n(AI). This controversial topic has drawn great attention in public. However, we\nare still at a stage of divergent opinions without any definitive conclusion.\nMotivated by this, we raise the research question of \"is GPT-4 a good data\nanalyst?\" in this work and aim to answer it by conducting head-to-head\ncomparative studies. In detail, we regard GPT-4 as a data analyst to perform\nend-to-end data analysis with databases from a wide range of domains. We\npropose a framework to tackle the problems by carefully designing the prompts\nfor GPT-4 to conduct experiments. We also design several task-specific\nevaluation metrics to systematically compare the performance between several\nprofessional human data analysts and GPT-4. Experimental results show that\nGPT-4 can achieve comparable performance to humans. We also provide in-depth\ndiscussions about our results to shed light on further studies before reaching\nthe conclusion that GPT-4 can replace data analysts.\n\n\nTitle: Graph Neural Architecture Search with GPT-4\nSummary:   Graph Neural Architecture Search (GNAS) has shown promising results in\nautomatically designing graph neural networks. However, GNAS still requires\nintensive human labor with rich domain knowledge to design the search space and\nsearch strategy. In this paper, we integrate GPT-4 into GNAS and propose a new\nGPT-4 based Graph Neural Architecture Search method (GPT4GNAS for short). The\nbasic idea of our method is to design a new class of prompts for GPT-4 to guide\nGPT-4 toward the generative task of graph neural architectures. The prompts\nconsist of descriptions of the search space, search strategy, and search\nfeedback of GNAS. By iteratively running GPT-4 with the prompts, GPT4GNAS\ngenerates more accurate graph neural networks with fast convergence.\nExperimental results show that embedding GPT-4 into GNAS outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art GNAS methods.\n\n\nTitle: Solving Challenging Math Word Problems Using GPT-4 Code Interpreter with\n  Code-based Self-Verification\nSummary:   Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and PaLM-2 has\nbrought significant advancements in addressing math reasoning problems. In\nparticular, OpenAI's latest version of GPT-4, known as GPT-4 Code Interpreter,\nshows remarkable performance on challenging math datasets. In this paper, we\nexplore the effect of code on enhancing LLMs' reasoning capability by\nintroducing different constraints on the \\textit{Code Usage Frequency} of GPT-4\nCode Interpreter. We found that its success can be largely attributed to its\npowerful skills in generating and executing code, evaluating the output of code\nexecution, and rectifying its solution when receiving unreasonable outputs.\nBased on this insight, we propose a novel and effective prompting method,\nexplicit \\uline{c}ode-based \\uline{s}elf-\\uline{v}erification~(CSV), to further\nboost the mathematical reasoning potential of GPT-4 Code Interpreter. This\nmethod employs a zero-shot prompt on GPT-4 Code Interpreter to encourage it to\nuse code to self-verify its answers. In instances where the verification state\nregisters as ``False'', the model shall automatically amend its solution,\nanalogous to our approach of rectifying errors during a mathematics\nexamination. Furthermore, we recognize that the states of the verification\nresult indicate the confidence of a solution, which can improve the\neffectiveness of majority voting. With GPT-4 Code Interpreter and CSV, we\nachieve an impressive zero-shot accuracy on MATH dataset \\textbf{(53.9\\% $\\to$\n84.3\\%)}.\n\n\nTitle: OpenAI Cribbed Our Tax Example, But Can GPT-4 Really Do Tax?\nSummary:   The authors explain where OpenAI got the tax law example in its livestream\ndemonstration of GPT-4, why GPT-4 got the wrong answer, and how it fails to\nreliably calculate taxes.\n\n\nTitle: GPT-4 Understands Discourse at Least as Well as Humans Do\nSummary:   We test whether a leading AI system GPT-4 understands discourse as well as\nhumans do, using a standardized test of discourse comprehension. Participants\nare presented with brief stories and then answer eight yes/no questions probing\ntheir comprehension of the story. The questions are formatted to assess the\nseparate impacts of directness (stated vs. implied) and salience (main idea vs.\ndetails). GPT-4 performs slightly, but not statistically significantly, better\nthan humans given the very high level of human performance. Both GPT-4 and\nhumans exhibit a strong ability to make inferences about information that is\nnot explicitly stated in a story, a critical test of understanding.\n\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNext speaker: AI_ComputerScience_Expert\n\nAI_ComputerScience_Expert (to chat_manager):\n\nThe search results from arXiv provide a diverse range of papers discussing the capabilities and applications of GPT-4.

To further validate these applications, we could consider setting up experiments or simulations that specifically test GPT-4's performance in these areas. For instance, in the context of dementia diagnosis, we could simulate a diagnostic process using GPT-4 and compare its accuracy and efficiency against traditional AI tools. Similarly, for data analysis and graph neural architecture search, we could benchmark GPT-4 against current state-of-the-art methods to quantitatively assess its improvements or shortcomings.\n\nThese practical evaluations would provide a more concrete understanding of how GPT-4 can be integrated into software solutions and its potential impact on improving functionalities and user experiences. If needed, I can assist in designing these experiments or simulations to ensure they are robust and provide meaningful insights.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNext speaker: AI_ComputerScience_Expert\n\nAI_ComputerScience_Expert (to chat_manager):\n\nAbsolutely, setting up experiments or simulations to test GPT-4's performance in specific applications would be a crucial step in validating its practical utility and integration into software solutions. For the dementia diagnosis application, we could use a dataset of clinical cases to evaluate the model's diagnostic accuracy and compare it with traditional AI systems. This would involve not only accuracy but also examining aspects like false positives and negatives, which are critical in medical diagnostics.\n\nFor data analysis, we could design a set of tasks that mimic real-world data analysis scenarios. These tasks could include data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and predictive modeling. GPT-4's performance can be evaluated based on its accuracy, efficiency, and the insights it generates compared to human data analysts or other AI tools.\n\nIn the case of graph neural architecture search, we could use standard datasets and benchmarks in the field to test the effectiveness of the architectures designed by GPT-4. Metrics such as the time taken to design the architecture, performance of the designed network on test data, and comparison with architectures designed by human experts or other automated systems would be valuable.\n\nThese experiments would not only help in understanding GPT-4's capabilities but also in identifying areas where it might need further improvement.
